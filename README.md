# EMF_VisualizationAndCalculation_Project1
In this MATLAB project, I used laplace equations and forward/backwards difference formulas to calculate the electric potential and electric field at all grid points ine a given domain.  These values were then used to make plots of the equipotential lines and field intensity, as well as calculating energy and capacitance of the device.
