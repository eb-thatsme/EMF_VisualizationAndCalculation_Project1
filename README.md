# EMF_VisualizationAndCalculation_Project1
In this MATLAB project, laplace transform equations and forward/backwards difference formulas were used to calculate the electric potential and electric field at all grid points in a given domain. These values were then used to make visual plots of the equipotential lines and field intensity, as well as calculating energy and capacitance of the device.
